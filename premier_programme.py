I am signing up for Replit's 100 days of Python challenge!
I will make sure to spend some time every day coding along, for a minimum of 10 minutes a day.
I'll be using Vs Code, an amazing IDE so I can do this from my laptop wherever I happen to be. No excuses for not coding from the middle of the field!
